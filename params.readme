# This is file containing documentation for parameters file in RBN 1.0
# Author: Piotr Jan Gorski
# Date: 2014-12-20
# Possible variables are listed below. Each variable has its special name. In order to add a variable you need to write its name and afterwards value(s).
# Names and values should be space-seperated.
# Parameters are divided into 3 groups: model parameters (physics), simulation parameters (computer science) and saving-data parameters.
# The lines below contain (here: coma-seperated) parameters' names, their default values (if not declared) and little information about them

N,0,number of networks, or range of networks to be investigated, single integer - one network, two integers - networks from N_beg to N_end with step 1, three integers are N_beg, N_end, N_step (integer or vector of integers) REQUIRED
A,0,number of attributes, or range of attributes to be investigated, single integer - one attributes, two integers - attributes from attr_beg to attr_end with step 1, three integers are attr_beg, attr_end, attr_step (integer or vector of integers) REQUIRED
p,0,number of p values, or range of p values to be investigated, single integer - one p value, two integers - ps from p_beg to p_end with step 1, three integers are p_beg, p_end, p_step (integer or vector of integers) REQUIRED
